    "Seems to have worked! Now let's take a closer look at how we will try to extract the Rf values. \n",
    "Throughout different testing until now, we found several criteria that need to be defined in the Regex pattern for the Rf value: it should be a number following the general pattern 0.XY with Y not being obligatory and X being some digit between 2 and 8 (this is to exclude as many other matches as possible and as Rf values should ideally be around 0.5, we thought this would be optimal). Furthermore, the pattern should not be followed by other digits (e.g. 0.45005) nor include special signs (0.5:0.4) or temperature values. The last remaining problem is, to distinguish between information about quantity and the Rf value (e.g. 0.56 vs. 0.56 mg)."

According to TLC (100% ethyl acetate) the spot for starting chloride was replaced by a much lower Rf, ninhydrin-positive spot. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (400 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×75 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine (2×200 mL) then dried (MgSO4) and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on an Analogix IF-280 (Analogix SF40-120 g, 99:1 ethyl acetate/methanol).
